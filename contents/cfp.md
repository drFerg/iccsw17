The fifth Imperial College Computing Student Workshop (ICCSW) aims to
provide an international forum for doctoral students in computing. While
most conferences and workshops in academia solely cater for specific
research areas, ICCSW encourages doctoral students from all disciplines
in computer science to submit papers and take part in the event. It is a
workshop organised by students for students. The workshop will be hosted
by the [Department of Computing](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/) at
[Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/).

The workshop offers:

* The workshop will offer several tracks. These will be confirmed soon.

### Important Dates

* Abstracts due: TBC
* Paper submission due: TBC
* Acceptance notification: TBC
* Final papers due: TBC

### Submission

Information on submission will be confirmed soon.

### Registration

Registration is free of charge for all students. Some student bursaries,
funded by industrial sponsors, will be made available to students with
submissions accepted in the workshop. We aim to provide financial
support for students who otherwise would be unable to attend.

### Organisation

The local steering committee will consist of research students from the
department, who will be responsible for the organisation of the
workshop. Research students from outside Imperial College are invited to
become members of the organising committee as ambassadors of the
workshop in their respective university to promote and coordinate
students wishing to participate in the workshop.
The current list of organising committee members can be found in the
[Organisation](/2013/organisation.html) page.
